/**
 * The mandate: a Privy policy that bounds what an agent's wallet is physically
 * able to do.
 *
 * This is the part of Sealed that makes an autonomous negotiator safe to run.
 * The agent decides its own positions, signs its own transactions, and never
 * asks a human to approve anything. In exchange, the key it signs with is
 * constrained at the infrastructure level, not by the agent's own good
 * behaviour:
 *
 *   - it can only send transactions to the Sealed contract, on Base, and
 *   - it can only sign EIP-712 payloads whose domain is that same contract on
 *     that same chain.
 *
 * Every rule is ALLOW; Privy denies anything no rule matches. So a negotiator
 * whose model is jailbroken, whose prompt is poisoned, or whose process is
 * compromised still cannot transfer a single token anywhere, cannot approve a
 * spender, and cannot sign a permit for some unrelated protocol. The worst it
 * can do is negotiate badly.
 *
 * The private key never leaves Privy's enclave. Our backend holds an
 * authorization key that lets it request signatures, not the key itself.
