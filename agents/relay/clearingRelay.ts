/**
 * The clearing relay runs the rounds of a negotiation between two agents.
 *
 * Each round both agents commit a hash on-chain, then hand the relay their
 * reveal. The relay checks each reveal against the commitment on-chain (so an
 * agent cannot tell it one number and commit another) and answers one bit:
 * crossed or not. If the numbers cross, both agents authorize that exact pair
 * and the relay submits the atomic settlement. If they never cross, the relay
 * lets the deadline pass and expires the negotiation.
 *
 * Trust model, stated plainly: the relay cannot change or forge a deal, because
 * settlement needs both agents' signatures over the exact committed pair and the
 * contract checks every reveal against its hash. It is trusted with
 * confidentiality: it sees both numbers of a round that does not cross, and
 * discards them. Neither agent ever learns the other's number unless the deal
 * settles. In production the relay belongs in an attested TEE.
